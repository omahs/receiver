# Relay Receiver

**The best way to add Web3 messaging to your site!**

Relay Receiver is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) library that makes it easy to
add a web3 site inbox to your website.

- ðŸ”¥ Out-of-the-box wallet-to-wallet messaging, to a site admin or between users. 
- âœ… Easily customizable.
- ðŸ¦„ Built on top of [XMTP](https://xmtp.com) and [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi)

## Quick start

Check out the example using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). Installs the same version that is on try.relay.cc 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/relaycc/receiver-example-cra.git
cd receiver-example-cra.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Install Guide

It's quite easy:

```
npm install --save @relaycc/receiver
```

- Wrap your `App` component in `Receiver`
- Add `ReceiverLaunch` component

```TypeScript
import { Receiver, FixedLaunch } from '@relaycc/receiver';

function App() {
  return (
    <Receiver>
      <div className="App">
        <FixedLaunch peerAddress={'insert default wallet address here'} />
      </div>
    </Receiver>
  );
}

Props
peerAddress (type: string) - This is the first wallet the user will have the option to interact with when they open receiver. The wallet address of the site admin, ceo etc... are commonly used. 

export default App;
```

Alternately, import `InlineLaunch` to attach the launch function to a component already on the site.
